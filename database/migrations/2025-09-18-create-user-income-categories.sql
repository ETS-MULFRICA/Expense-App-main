-- User-specific income categories table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_income_categories (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
The form now always gets the latest categoryName from the form state at submission, ensuring it matches against the categories list and is never undefined. The payload will always include a valid categoryId (for existing categories) or a categoryName (for new categories).

Please try again—type or select a category and submit. The debug output should now show the correct category info, and the backend should accept the request. Let me know if it works!
